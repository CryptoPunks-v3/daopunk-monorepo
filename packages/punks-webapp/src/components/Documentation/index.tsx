            DAOpunks are an experimental attempt to improve the coordination and funding of the{' '}
            {cryptopunksLink} community. CryptoPunks are one of the largest NFT projects by market
            cap, but the community is completely cash poor. There is no treasury to encourage Punk
            innovation or to sponsor Punk community events.
            <br />
            Nouns was first inspired by CryptoPunks, and now it's the Punks' turn to be inspired by
            Nouns. This is an attempt to bootstrap the coordination, governance, and treasury of one
            of the most recognizable avatars in crypto. LFG!

                Punkers DAO utilizes a fork of Compound Governance and is the main governing body of
                the DAOpunks ecosystem. The Punkers DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from
                daily DAOpunks auctions. Each CryptoPunk and DAOpunk is an irrevocable member of the
                Punkers DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance matters. CryptoPunk and DAOpunk
                vote are non-transferable (if you sell your CryptoPunk or DAOpunk the vote goes with it) but delegatable,
                which means you can assign your vote to someone else as long as you own your CryptoPunks or DAOpunk.

                  DAOpunks are stored directly on Ethereum and do not utilize pointers to other
                  networks such as IPFS. This is possible because DAOpunk parts are compressed and
                  stored on-chain using a custom run-length encoding (RLE), which is a form of
                  lossless compression.

              <p>
                <Trans>
                  The compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoding SVG
                  image on-chain. To accomplish this, each part is decoded into an intermediate
                  format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain
                  string concatenation. Once the entire SVG has been generated, it is base64
                  encoded.

                  The DAOpunk Seeder contract is used to determine DAOpunk traits during the minting
                  process. The seeder contract can be replaced to allow for future trait generation
                  algorithm updates. Additionally, it can be locked by the Punkers DAO to prevent any
                  future updates. Currently, DAOpunk traits are determined using a pseudo-random number
                  generation:
